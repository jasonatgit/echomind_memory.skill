## v1.1.0 New Features

**Core Highlights:**
*Introducing a **dedicated Reflection Engine Agent** that proactively distills semantic memory and procedural memory from raw episodic memory. Analogous to human "bedtime reflection" or the Reflexion/SRMA architecture.*

| Feature | Description |
|------|------|
| **Self-Evolving Engine Agent** 🧠 | Automatically extracts long-term knowledge from raw conversations. Auto-triggers **self-reflection** to distill raw interaction records into persistent knowledge, user preferences, and procedural rules — achieving true memory self-evolution |
| **Upgraded RL Capabilities** | RL weight range mode, random sampling, automatic convergence from user feedback |
| **Configurable Domain Prompts** | Domain prompts are now configuration-driven — no code changes needed for tuning |
| **Confidence Filtering** | Reflection results below the confidence threshold are automatically discarded, **preventing hallucination pollution of memory** |
| **Memory Source Tracking** | Complete storage of reflection records with platform tags and source traceability |
| **Importance Scoring** | Scores memory importance, preserving valuable memories |
| **Multi-Trigger Retrieval** | Keywords + RL weights + LLM semantics — a true "semantic memory system" |
| **Memory Isolation** | Isolation by user, project, session, topic, and research domain — no more memory chaos |
| **Architecture Upgrade** | New reflection engine architecture supporting highly flexible prompt configuration |

## Acknowledgments

We sincerely thank the authors of the above papers for their pioneering work on self-reflective memory mechanisms. Their research has provided valuable theoretical foundations and inspiration for the design of EchoMind-Memory.skill's Self-Reflective Agent.

The technical design of this project's Self-Reflective Agent benefits from the inspiration of the above groundbreaking research. We extend our sincere academic gratitude to the paper authors.

At the same time, EchoMind-Memory.skill's "self-evolution" primarily differs from the above scientific research in its adoption of **dependency inversion** (core engine with zero LLM coupling), **platform-aware isolation**, and **zero-configuration deployment** — making it directly usable in production Multi-Agent systems without additional infrastructure. This is a production-grade agent application.

| `on_session_switch()` | Fixes session ID corruption after `/resume` `/branch` `/reset` operations (fixes session ID corruption after session switch operations) |
| `on_pre_compress()` | Auto-saves memories about to be discarded before context compression (auto-saves memories before context compression discards them) |
| `on_delegation()` | Captures sub-agent task experience into long-term memory (captures sub-agent task experience into long-term memory) |



### v1.0.9 — OpenClaw / OpenCode / Claude Code Three-Platform Compatibility Fix (2026-05-16)

| Fix | Affected Platforms |
|--------|---------|
| `main.py` added `call()` dispatch function | OpenClaw |
